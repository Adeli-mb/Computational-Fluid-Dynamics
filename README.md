<h1>Computational Fluid Dynamics</h1>



<h2>Project Outline</h2>
Modelled an 320 and ran CFD simulations to optimise tail design for increased lift and reduced drag. 
<br />


<h2>How? - Design Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Switched to a cruciform tail to improve stability and aerodynamics </li>
<li>CAD optimisation â€“ simplified and scaled down model to reduce computational load when running CFD simulations. The CFD software utilised Navier Stokes equations and mesh sensitivity tests to ensure accuracy.</li>
<li>100 iterations per simulation were undertaken to allow for mesh convergence , ensuring accuracy </li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
    <ul>
  <li>The cruciform tail design showed 7% increase in lift to drag ratio and a drag reduction of 20% at cruise conditions. There was also increased stability due to the optimised horizontal stabiliser placement.</li>
  <li>This project demonstrate how tail modifications can significantly impact fuel efficiency and range.</li>
  <li>Provided a scalable method for further design improvements in commercial aviation.</li>
</ul>
